### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Civil Enginner and Software Delevoper, i work to create computacional enginner solutions that are in agreement current standarts (NBR - Norma Brasileira) applied to civil engineering. My research field is numeric methods, finite elements, finite volums and finite differences. I developed public and private repositories applied to various areas of structural engineering, such as reinforced concrete, prestressed concrete, shallow and deep foundations, geotency tests. I am currently a scholarship holder in the master's degree in computational modeling with the research line of computational mechanics. Both in my undergraduate and master's degrees, I studied civil engineering and programming together.

I am willing to collaborate with open source projects, private projects, or projects that generate patents, as long as they are applied to civil engineering.
